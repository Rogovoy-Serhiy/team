        <p class="article__text">The goal of the game is to help the frogs get to their lilypads by writing CSS code. See if you can beat all the levels!</p>
        <p class="article__text">Flexbox Froggy takes inspiration from the classic arcade game Frogger, and web literacy games like the brilliant CSS Diner and Erase All Kittens, where you learn about CSS selectors and HTML markup respectively.</p>
        <p class="article__text">Flexbox is also a good topic because beginners can learn this improved way of positioning right out of the gate, while many experienced web developers who arenâ€™t familiar with it yet can finally get on with it. There are topnotch tutorials out there for this purpose like those by CSS Tricks, Codrops, and Scotch.io, but few interactive learning experiences.</p>
        <p class="article__text">If you are interested in modern web development and are not yet familiar with flexbox and cssgrid technologies, then I have great news for you. There are several games and interactive little tutorials for learning them. After going through them to the end, you will easily figure out these things.</p>
